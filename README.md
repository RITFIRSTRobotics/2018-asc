Arduino Scoring and Controller (ASC) code and schematics for Imagine RIT 2018 

## Compilation and Installation

Firmware can be installed onto your Arduino Mega by running `arudev startdev`, which will open Arduino IDE with all the required files. All you need to do is set the correct COM port and board, then compile and upload.

If you do not have `arudev` installed, go see it's [repository](https://github.com/thatging3rkid/arudev).
